<h1>Welcome to the Money Manager Web App</h1>
<p>This application is currently a work in progress.</p>
<br />

<h4>Purpose</h4>
<p>Money Manager is designed to help you track your income and expenses throughout the month, giving you a clear picture of where your money is going.</p>
<p>By gaining better control over your finances, you can make informed decisions, build healthier financial habits, and work toward your personal goals.</p>
<br />

<h4>Tech Stack</h4>
<p>This web app is built using <strong>Blazor with .NET 8.0, HTML, CSS, and MongoDB</strong> as its database.</p>
<p>It emphasizes <strong>componentization</strong>, making the codebase more efficient, easier to maintain, and scalable for future enhancements.</p>
<br />

<h4>Road Map</h4>
Here are a few things that I want to add to this applicaton, and will try to do so in the future:

<ul>
    <li><strong>Host</strong> - Deploy the application on a web service for seamless access.</li>

    <li><strong>User Login</strong> - Implement user authentication to allow multiple users to manage their personal finances securely.</li>

    <li><strong>Configuration View</strong> - Simplifies the creation of month sheets with predefined categories and estimated values.</li>

    <li><strong>Input Colors</strong> - Highlights positive and negative values for better visualization.</li>

    <li><strong>Balance Overview</strong> - Provides a clear, at-a-glance summary of your account balances.</li>

    <li><strong>Filtering Options</strong> - Enables sorting and filtering of financial records for better organization.</li>

    <li><strong>Graphs & Insights</strong> - Visualizes your financial performance over the month and year, offering future estimations based on your current trends.</li>

</ul>

    I’m excited to continue improving this app and making it a valuable tool for financial management.
    Stay tuned for updates!
